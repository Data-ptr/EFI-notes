For comparison purposes only - do not use an LM2940 in an EFI!!!!!

LM2940 thermal

from datasheet:
Tj max = 150C
The value of R θJA (for devices in still air with no heatsink) is 23.3°C/W for the TO-220 package (page 4)
however this is contrdicted by the max. power dissipation of 1W at 100C which implies 50 C/W (figure 23)
For comparison an LM7805 is rated at 23.9C/W so 23.3C/W is not unfeasible - maybe they have already de-rated to Tj = 125 for reliabilty.

For automotive use de-rate Tj to 125C for reliability.
if we assume max. ambient = 50C, but we allow a 75C rise
75/23.3 = 3.22W

At 16V (max. continuous ISO 16750)
16-5 = 9V drop
Imax = 3.22W/9V = 358mA

With a heatsink:

from LM2940 datasheet:
using a heatsink with RTHsa = 21.7C/W
and 1.1C/W Thjc (bottom) then:

75/(21.7+1.1) = 3.29W
3.29W/9V = 365mA
