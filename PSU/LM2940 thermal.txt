For comparison purposes only - do not use an LM2940 in an EFI!!!!!

LM2940 thermal

Tj max = 150C
THja typ 62.5C (typical TO220 package)

De-rate Tj to 125C

max. ambient = 50C, allow 75C rise
75/62.5 = 1.2W

At 18V
18-5 = 13V drop
Imax = 1.2/13 = 92.3mA

heatsink required!!!!

from LM2940 datasheet:
using a heatsink with RTHsa = 21.7C/W
and 1.1C/W Thjc (bottom) then:

75/(21.7+1.1) = 3.29W
1.2/3.29 = 367mA
