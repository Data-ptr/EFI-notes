For comparison purposes only - do not use an LM2940 in an EFI!!!!!

LM2940 thermal

from datasheet:
Tj max = 150C
The value of R θJA (for devices in still air with no heatsink) is 23.3°C/W for the TO-220 package (page 4)
however this is contradicted by the max. power dissipation of 1W at 100C which implies 50 C/W (figure 23)
The note on page 18 states:
    "If the maximum allowable value for RθJA is found to be ≥ 23.3°C/W for the TO-220
  package (with a heatsink of 21.7°C/W RθSA) ...... no heatsink is needed since the package alone
  will dissipate enough heat to satisfy these requirements."
In section 6.4 Rθjc(bottom) is stated as 1.1C/W, 1.1 + 21.7 = 22.8C/W which implies Rθcs =   0.5C/W.

For comparison an LM7805 is rated at 23.9C/W so 23.3C/W is not unfeasible - maybe they have already de-rated to Tj = 125 for reliabilty.

For automotive use de-rate Tj to 125C for reliability.
if we assume max. ambient = 50C, but we allow a 75C rise
75/23.3 = 3.22W

At 16V (max. continuous ISO 16750)
16-5 = 9V drop
Imax = 3.22W/9V = 358mA

With a heatsink:

from LM2940 datasheet:
using a heatsink with RTHsa = 10C/W and assuming Rθcs = 2C/W
and 1.1C/W Thjc (bottom) then:

75/(10+2+1.1) = 5.73W
5.73W/9V = 365mA

10C/W is a big heatsink! most smaller heatsinks for a TO220 package are rated at around 20C/W 
20 + 2 + 1.1 = 23.1 C/W so the either difference is negligible or somwthing is awry with the calculations or the power dissipation claims for the TO220 package used for the LM2940.
