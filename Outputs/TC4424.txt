Output impedance = 3.5R typ. 5R max.

max. dissipation = 470mW (70C)
Tj max. = 150C

THja = 125C/W

at 70C

125-70 = 55C

55/125 = 0.44W (both channels)

@ 5R
	0.44/5 = 88mA
	
per channel = 44mA continuous

Wasted spark 4-cyl

@7000rpm, 2 sparks/rev @3ms 

7000rpm = 116.67Hz = 8.6ms

6/8.6 = 70% duty cycle

44mA/0.7 = 63mA
